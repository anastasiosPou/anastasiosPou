Hello there! I'm Anastasios Poursaitides. I'm a Software Engineer with 2 years of professional experience on making engaging experiences for the web. I'm focused on creating scalable but most importantly accessible software to all. 


## About Me 👨🏻‍💻
I've accumulated 10 years of knowledge in programming through 4 years of college but mostly through self-taught and that led me to my first professional job as a Software Engineer at a company that deals with, creates, and maintains casino solutions(platforms, games etc.). My background on Tourism 
has given me the crusial soft skills to engage, collaborate and lead in a fast-growing environment.
